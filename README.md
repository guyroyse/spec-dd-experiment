# Spec-Driven Development

This project explores spec-driven development—an approach where specifications *are* the program. Instead of writing code and then documenting it, you write specifications first and let an AI generate the implementation.

## The Idea

Traditional development treats code as the artifact and documentation as an afterthought. Spec-driven development inverts this: the specifications are the artifact, and code is a generated byproduct.

This means:

- Specs are written by humans for the AI to read, not for test frameworks
- Implementation details are inferred, not specified
- Code can be regenerated whenever the specs change

## How It Works

The project uses two prompts that put an AI assistant into different modes:

### Author Mode (`prompts/AUTHOR.md`)

Use this when defining *what* the application should do. The AI becomes a spec authoring partner that helps you write Gherkin specifications, maintain a domain glossary, and define the tech stack. It will push back on vague requirements, suggest edge cases, and catch contradictions—but it won't write code.

### Compile Mode (`prompts/COMPILE.md`)

Use this when you want to generate code. The AI reads the specs and stack, then produces a working implementation. It treats the specs as the source of truth and the `/src` directory as disposable output that can be regenerated at any time.

### Schemas

The `/schemas` directory contains the data schemas for the application. They describe the physical schema for each datastore, including key patterns, field names, types, defaults, relationships, and conventions.

These are generated by the AI but, unlike code, they are not disposable and once generated are constraints for future compilations. This preserves compatibility between versions.

Changes can be made to the schema files, but they must be backwards compatible and/or include migration logic depending on the datastore.

## Project Structure

| Path                 | Description                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `/prompts`           | The AI prompts that drive the workflow  |
| `/schemas`           | Generated data schemas                  |
| `/specs`             | Gherkin specifications (.feature files) |
| `/specs/GLOSSARY.md` | Domain terms and definitions            |
| `/stack/STACK.md`    | Tech stack and architectural decisions  |
| `/src `              | Generated code (disposable)             |

## Branches

- **main** — A todo application built using this approach. Use this to see spec-driven development in action.
- **stock** — Contains just the prompts and project structure. Suitable as a starting point for any project.
