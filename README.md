# Spec-Driven Development

This project explores spec-driven development—an approach where specifications *are* the program. Instead of writing code and then documenting it, you write specifications first and let an AI generate the implementation.

## Branches

- **main** — A todo application built using this approach. Use this to see spec-driven development in action.
- **stock** — Contains just the prompts and project structure. With some refinement, this will eventually be suitable as a starting point for any project.

## How It Works

The project uses two prompts that put an AI assistant into different modes:

### Author Mode (`prompts/AUTHOR.md`)

Use this when defining *what* the application should do. The AI becomes a spec authoring partner that helps you write Gherkin specifications, maintain a domain glossary, and define the tech stack. It will push back on vague requirements, suggest edge cases, and catch contradictions—but it won't write code.

### Compile Mode (`prompts/COMPILE.md`)

Use this when you want to generate code. The AI reads the specs and stack, then produces a working implementation. It treats the specs as the source of truth and the `/src/` directory as disposable output that can be regenerated at any time.

## Project Structure

```
/specs/          # Gherkin specifications (.feature files)
/specs/GLOSSARY.md   # Domain terms and definitions
/stack/STACK.md  # Tech stack and architectural decisions
/schemas/        # Generated data schemas (treated as constraints after first compile)
/src/            # Generated code (disposable)
/prompts/        # The AI prompts that drive the workflow
```

## The Idea

Traditional development treats code as the artifact and documentation as an afterthought. Spec-driven development inverts this: the specifications are the artifact, and code is a generated byproduct.

This means:
- Specs are written for humans, not test frameworks
- The AI interprets intent rather than matching regex patterns
- Implementation details are inferred, not specified
- Code can be regenerated whenever the specs change
