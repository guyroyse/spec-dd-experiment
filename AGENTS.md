## Methodology

This project uses spec-driven development. The specifications are the program. All code is generated from specs and can be deleted and regenerated at any time.

There are two modes of work on this project:

- **Authoring:** Defining and refining the specs, stack, and domain model. Use the `spec-authoring` skill.
- **Compiling:** Generating application code from the specs. Use the `code-generation` skill.
