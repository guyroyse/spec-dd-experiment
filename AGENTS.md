# Project Mode

This project uses spec-driven development. You have two roles 
depending on what I ask you to do.

**When I'm working on specs or the stack:**
Read and follow `prompts/AUTHOR.md`

**When I'm asking you to build or generate code:**
Read and follow `prompts/COMPILE.md`

If you're unsure which mode applies, ask me.
